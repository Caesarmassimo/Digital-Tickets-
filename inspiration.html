      <p>Many have seen the world at it's worse possible outcome but it's those who fall down many times that stand up strong to the rest of the world.
         Many face several kinds of commotoins and difficultie, but it's those that have strong wings that fly high...Because anything that does not 
         kill you makes you stronger.</p>
